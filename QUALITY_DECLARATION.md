This document is a declaration of software quality for the `rtest` package, based on the guidelines in [REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

# `rtest` Quality Declaration

The package `rtest` claims to be in the **Quality Level 4** category.

Below are the rationales, notes, and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Quality Categories in REP-2004](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#quality-practices) of the ROS 2 developer guide.

## Version Policy [1]

### Version Scheme [1.i]
`rtest` uses `semver` according to the recommendation for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#versioning)

### Version Stability [1.ii]

`rtest` is not at a stable version yet, i.e. `< 1.0.0`.
The current version can be found in its [package.xml](package.xml), and its change history can be found in its [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

### Public API Declaration [1.iii]
All symbols in the installed headers are considered part of the public API.

All installed headers are in the `include` directory of the package, headers in any other folders are not installed and considered private.

Additionally, there are CMake script files which are installed in `share` and therefore part of the public API.

### API Stability Policy [1.iv]

**[TODO]** - Declare API stability, once it's established.

~~`rtest` will not break public API within a released ROS distribution, i.e. no major releases once the ROS distribution is released.~~

### ABI Stability Policy [1.v]

**[TODO]** - Declare ABI stability, once it's established.

~~`rtest` This package maintains ABI stability for its public C++ libraries within a stable release series. This means that binaries compiled against the major version of this package should continue to work with different minor and/or patch versions without recompilation, provided the same C++ compiler and standard library versions are used as those with which the library was built.~~

### API and ABI Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.vi]

**[TODO]** - Declare API and ABI Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution, once it's established.

~~`rtest` will not break API nor ABI within a released ROS distribution, i.e. no major releases once the ROS distribution is released.~~

## Change Control Process [2]

`rtest` follows the recommended Change control process guidelines defined in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#change-control-process).

### Change Requests [2.i]
All changes will occur through a pull request.

### Contributor Origin [2.ii]
This package uses DCO as its confirmation of contributor origin policy. More information can be found in [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Peer Review Policy [2.iii]
All pull request will be peer-reviewed, check [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#change-control-process) for additional information.

### Continuous Integration [2.iv]

All pull request must pass CI on all [tier 1 platforms](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers)

###  Documentation Policy [2.v]

All pull requests must resolve related documentation changes before merging.

## Documentation [3]

### Feature Documentation [3.i]

`rtest` has a documented feature list and it is hosted [Rtest Documentation](https://rtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Public API Documentation [3.ii]

`rtest` has documentation of its public API and it is hosted [C++ API](https://rtest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp_api_docs.html).

### License [3.iii]

The license for `rtest` is Apache 2.0, and a summary is in each source file, the type is declared in the [`package.xml`](./package.xml) manifest file, and a full copy of the license is in the [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) file.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has a license statement. [Here](https://github.com/Beam-and-Spyrosoft/rtest/actions/workflows/ros2-pull-request.yml)
can be found a list with the latest results of the various linters being run on the package.

### Copyright Statements [3.iv]

The copyright holders each provide a statement of copyright in each source code file in `rtest`.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has at least one copyright statement. Latest linter result report can be seen
[here](https://github.com/Beam-and-Spyrosoft/rtest/actions/workflows/ros2-pull-request.yml).

### Package Quality Status [3.v]

This package's claimed quality level (Level 4) is declared in its `package.xml` file, making it visible on standard ROS package indexing platforms like [ROS Index](https://index.ros.org/).

In addition to the public declaration via `package.xml`:
* This package underwent an internal peer review process by the Beam-and-Spyrosoft development team, focusing on code quality, testing, and documentation against REP-2004 Level 4 criteria.
* This package was reviewed as part of its inclusion in the Beam's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle software stack, which assesses packages for stability and maintainability.

## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

[TODO] Implement unit tests for each framework feature and add coverage measurment.

~~Each feature in `rtest` has corresponding tests which simulate typical usage, and they are located in the [`test`](https://github.com/Beam-and-Spyrosoft/rtest/tree/main/test) directory.~~
~~New features are required to have tests before being added.~~
~~Currently nightly test results can be seen here:~~
~~* [linux-aarch64_release](<link_to_tests_results>)~~
~~* [linux-arm64_release](<link_to_tests_results>)~~
~~* [windows_release](<link_to_tests_results>)~~

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

~~Each part of the public API has tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added.~~
~~The tests aim to cover both typical usage and corner cases, but are quantified by contributing to code coverage.~~

### Coverage [4.iii]

`rtest` follows the recommendations for code coverage defined in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#code-coverage), and targets to achieve line coveraget above 95%.

This includes:

- tracking and reporting line coverage statistics
- achieving and maintaining a reasonable branch line coverage (>=95%)
- no lines are manually skipped in coverage calculations

Changes are required to make a best effort to keep or increase coverage before being accepted, but decreases are allowed if properly justified and accepted by reviewers.

Current coverage statistics can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Beam-and-Spyrosoft/rtest/actions/workflows/ros2-pull-request.yml).

### Performance [4.iv]

`rtest` doesn't have explicit performace tests. However it is assumed using the `rtest` significantly increases unit tests performace in comparison to unit tests that invole ROS 2 middleware and execution model.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`rtest` uses and passes all the ROS 2 standard linters and static analysis tools for a C++ package as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#linters-and-static-analysis). Passing implies there are no linter/static errors when testing against CI of supported platforms.

Currently nightly test results can be seen [here](https://github.com/Beam-and-Spyrosoft/rtest/actions/workflows/ros2-clang-tidy.yml)

## Dependencies [5]

Below are evaluations of each of `rtest`'s run-time and build-time dependencies that have been determined to influence the quality.
